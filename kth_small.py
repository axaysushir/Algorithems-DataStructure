# where pivot itself is kâ€™th smallest element. Also, not to recur for both left and right sides of pivot,
#  but recur for one of them according to the position of pivot. The worst case time complexity of this
#  method is O(n2), but it works in O(n) on average.

# In this post method 4 is discussed which is mainly an extension of method 3 (QuickSelect)

# swap the element at randomly generated index with the last element, and finally call the standard 
# partition process which uses last element as pivot.
